Dealerships in the US and beyond have experienced peaceful protests and occasional vandalism, while sales are down almost everywhere and the company has lost almost half its value in two months.\\n\\nIronically, these political controversies may broaden the mass market appeal of electric vehicles. This is an industry that needs to go beyond the early-adopter tech bros \\u2013 and now might be the moment.\\n\\nIn 2010, when Tesla became the first American carmaker to go public since Ford in 1956, fully electric cars were still a niche technology. The Nissan Leaf was launched that same year, but it was still limited to shorter trips in cities. Other big carmakers weren\\u2019t yet taking electric seriously, and the Chinese electric vehicle (EV) industry was just starting to gear up.\\n\\nIn 2013, when the International Energy Agency (IEA) produced its first Global EV Outlook report, there were less than 60,000 on the road worldwide. A decade later, almost the same number of EVs are sold every day.\\n\\nDong liu / Shutterstock\\n\\nSo, there is plenty of evidence that Tesla had a leading role in making EVs a \\u201cwinning technology\\u201d \\u2013 something the traditional major carmakers felt compelled to compete with. Governments around the world also got on board.\\n\\nNot made for the mainstream\\n\\nIn fact, Tesla\\u2019s approach to making electric cars mainstream was to not make them for the mainstream. Its marketing strategy was to sell direct to customers who not only bought into the environmental credentials but the hi-tech glamour \\u2013 and didn\\u2019t mind the price tag.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nIn other words, Tesla targeted \\u201cearly adopters\\u201d which, in the case of electric cars, meant wealthy men. Study after study shows these early adopters in North America and Europe were skewed towards men and those with higher incomes.\\n\\nAlthough these studies often measured income and gender separately, research I published with colleagues indicated it was having both characteristics \\u2013 being both a man and wealthy \\u2013 that made someone more likely to be an EV owner, or more likely to say their next car would probably be electric.\\n\\nOut of our representative sample of nearly 2,000 UK drivers, wealthy men were also more likely to agree that their social circle expected them to switch.\\n\\nWe did not find the same results among women, no matter their income level, nor low-income men. This despite the fact that women were significantly more likely to value protecting the environment and to feel an obligation to drive an electric car (if they were first convinced it would reduce carbon emissions and improve air quality).\\n\\nThis points to another key implication of our research. To support mass adoption, drivers need to be confident that EVs can deliver the environmental benefits they promise, as well as being more comfortable and cheaper to run than conventional cars.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nTo gain this confidence, drivers \\u2013 no matter who they are \\u2013 want to hear consistent messaging from a trusted source that highlights the benefits, not just the costs.\\n\\nHowever, as we found in our project Inclusive Transition to Electric Mobility, drivers and policymakers alike perceive EVs as unaffordable. Some research participants even mentioned Tesla by name when giving an example of how making the switch is beyond the means of people like them.\\n\\nCheaper EVs need new messaging\\n\\nAlthough Tesla sells mass-produced models and slashed its prices around the world last year, its cars are still expensive (in the UK, they start at about \\u00a340,000). The company\\u2019s reputation and brand is linked not only to the tech-bro image of Silicon Valley, but with elitism and inequity.\\n\\nHowever, the reputation of EVs in general need not be. Unlike ten years ago, this is a technology with momentum among many manufacturers, and consumers have plenty of new, cheaper models to choose from, as well as a growing second-hand market. The IEA\\u2019s latest report suggests EVs are finally becoming a mass-market product.\\n\\ni viewfinder / Shutterstock\\n\\nAs electric cars become more affordable in real terms, the messaging needs to be about environmental benefit rather than futuristic technology. It needs to emphasise long-term affordability of use as well as purchase. EVs need to be seen as practical and safe \\u2013 and drivers need to hear these messages from trusted sources.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nMy research highlighted how family, friends, colleagues and neighbours could be this source of trusted information. Early adopters I interviewed described the many personal, social interactions involved in the practicalities of parking and charging their cars \\u2013 such as coordinating workplace charging so no one is caught short, and sharing tips on the best tariff for home charging. Some have effectively become local ambassadors for EVs.\\n\\nI\\u2019m also investigating how communities coming together around EVs might lead to more car sharing. This could maximise the environmental benefits of the transition, since reducing the number of cars on the road is as important as ensuring cars switch from petrol to electric.\\n\\nThere is little doubt about the damage Musk\\u2019s political approach has done to Tesla\\u2019s image, although it is not the sole cause of the company\\u2019s current troubles.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the transition to electric personal mobility is well underway around the world. Tesla\\u2019s troubles won\\u2019t stop this \\u2013 but they can give the car industry an opportunity to make the messaging around electric vehicles more diverse, equitable and inclusive for the mass market.\\n\\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Both of my parents\\u2019 childhoods were deeply affected by colonialism in India and they often told me stories about this period in their lives. As a result, I inherited a sense of place and a feeling for a country which was never my home.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s a strange feeling, which I still struggle to put into words, though I tried in my memoir, Shalimar: A Story of Place and Migration, which holds at its heart the sensation and imagery of India\\u2019s climate and its wildlife. India, for me, will always coexist with English weather and the roses my father tended to in our modest, suburban home in Hayes, west London.\\n\\nWhile we now have beautifully written, tender children\\u2019s books which address colonial history, from Nazneen Ahmed Pathak\\u2019s City of Stolen Magic (2023) to Jasbinder Bilan\\u2019s Nush and the Stolen Emerald (2024), The Secret Garden still holds a powerful spell over me. That\\u2019s because of its representation of nature and its use of fiction to tell a story about England and India, two countries brought together through the healing space of the garden.\\n\\nI believe that re-contextualising A Secret Garden as an early work of climate fiction \\u2013 a type of storytelling that imagines how climate change could shape our world \\u2013 is an apt way to rethink this classic tale.\\n\\nThis article is part of Rethinking the Classics. The stories in this series offer insightful new ways to think about and interpret classic books and artworks. This is the canon \\u2013 with a twist.\\n\\nPublished in 1911, The Secret Garden unfolds against the backdrop of the fictional Misselthwaite Manor and its walled garden on the Yorkshire Moors.\\n\\nWhile Yorkshire and its thick sheets of rain, enveloped in mist and fog, is portrayed vividly by Hodgeson Burnett, the ghostly heat and skies of India are also woven throughout the book\\u2019s micro-climates. Hodgeson Burnett\\u2019s attention to nature is masterful and magical:\\n\\nOne knows it sometimes when one gets up at the tender solemn dawn-time and goes out and stands out and throws one\\u2019s head far back and looks up and up and watches the pale sky slowly changing and flushing \\u2026 And one knows it sometimes when one stands by oneself in a wood at sunset and the mysterious deep gold stillness slanting through and under the branches seems to be saying slowly again and again something one cannot quite hear, however much one tries.\\n\\nThe climates of India and Yorkshire blur into a new reality when seen through the eyes of the book\\u2019s central protagonist, the recently orphaned Mary Lennox. She is sent to live with her uncle after her parents die of cholera in colonial Calcutta.\\n\\nWilful and fiery, Mary\\u2019s grief and rootlessness seems to be unending until she follows a twitching robin into a walled garden. There she befriends other children including her cousin Colin, who uses a wheelchair, and the gardener, Weatherstaff.\\n\\nLooking for something good?

Sign up here.\\n\\nThe hidden sanctuary and wonder of the garden is intertwined with Mary\\u2019s inner world and her search for solace after the loss of her parents. Her resilience thrives and blooms, particularly when she becomes a storyteller and draws the other children into this secret place through her tales of adventure.\\n\\nHere, the telling of the \\u201cstory\\u201d of the garden is as important as the experience of the garden itself. This is where fiction does its work \\u2013 we need stories like this to recover a sense of care in times of ecological crisis.\\n\\nLast year saw the launch of the Climate Fiction Prize, a vital endeavour to specifically support literary fiction as a cultural form which permits writers the freedom to imagine alternative paths for human existence. The Secret Garden is a work of such imagination, of transformation from otherwise impossible states of crisis and inertia.\\n\\nBeyond the Canon\\n\\nAs part of the Rethinking the Classics series, we\\u2019re asking our experts to recommend a book or artwork that tackles similar themes to the canonical work in question, but isn\\u2019t (yet) considered a classic itself. Here is Davina Quinlivan\\u2019s suggestion:\\n\\nArthur A. Levine Books\\n\\nShaun Tan\\u2019s Tales From the Inner City (2018) is a beautiful and extremely moving collection of illustrated, eco-centric stories exploring the relationship between humans and animals in urban environments.\\n\\nTan is well known for his elegiac and often uncanny, playful storytelling and Tales From the Inner City skilfully braids these aesthetic values with a powerful message of hope and compassion for the wild and domestic creatures we share our world with. While there is no explicit reference to the climate crisis, Tan\\u2019s exquisite images illustrate stories of kinship between humans and dogs, snails, whales, pigeons, cats and tigers \\u2013 all bound to each other as intertwined species.\\n\\nSet within cities, the wild beauty of each animal seems enlarged, as does the poignancy of each story, reminding us of what we have to lose. Some of the creatures literally morph into giant versions of themselves, eerie against Tan\\u2019s various backdrops of urban space.

More info\\n\\nA number of new enterprises are busy attracting customers as a multi-million pound project to protect a Swansea community from the effects of climate change nears completion. The new arrivals range from a health and fitness centre to a contemporary outdoor lifestyle shop to a travel agency and hope to provide a shot in the arm for Mumbles after two years of works on sea defences along its famous promenade.\\n\\nJamie George is creating a gym with health and fitness facilities such as therapy suites in the former Mumbles RFC clubhouse, in Mumbles Road, close to Southend Gardens. The 33-year-old father-of-one plans to open in the coming weeks under the name Movement. For the latest Swansea news, sign up to our newsletter here.\\n\\nThe former Loughor RFC player said: \\u201cI\\u2019ve been a personal trainer for around a decade, based in Mayals for the past few years, and I\\u2019ve become aware that there\\u2019s a need for a new health and fitness facility in Mumbles. When the former rugby club base became available, I jumped at the chance to take it on and keep it as a community-focused space. The nearby sea defences work will improve the prom so there\\u2019ll be a lot of people strolling by the gym on a regular basis; I\\u2019m really excited about serving the local community.\\u201d\\n\\n(Image: Swansea Council)\\n\\nMatt Bryer has already opened his lifestyle and eco-conscious Hiatus shop on the Mumbles Road side of Oyster Wharf. Manager Lily Ella Westacott said: \\u201cWe love promoting an active, outdoor lifestyle, and Mumbles is the perfect place to do that. The new shop backs on to the seafront and prom; we\\u2019re close to the beautiful beaches of Langland and Caswell, attracting all sorts of people who share the passions that we love: fulfilling moments of pause for ourselves and the planet; supporting cultures of surfing, skating and climbing; exploring the planet we love while also looking after it. We only stock sustainable brands that share our values. With the improvement of the prom almost complete, we think it\\u2019ll have a positive impact on the Mumbles business community.\\u201d\\n\\nHiatus, which offers clothing and accessories from big-name brands such as Patagonia, Carhartt and Vans, was formerly based in Brynymor Road, St Helen\\u2019s, where it grew a strong customer base. Matt also previously ran a shop in Newton Road, Mumbles.\\n\\n(Image: Swansea Council)\\n\\nMeanwhile growing business Sam Smith Travel opened its shop in Newton Road, Mumbles, in January. Sales and commercial manager Suzanne Cumpston said: \\u201cWe\\u2019re really excited to have opened in Mumbles and we\\u2019ve had a great reception from local people. We chose Mumbles as our latest branch opening as we\\u2019re a great fit for the area, an independent family-owned Welsh business offering everything from weekend breaks to private charter flights, and from luxury cruises to sports holidays. Mumbles has a big future and, when the new-look prom is fully open, I\\u2019m sure local businesses will benefit.\\u201d\\n\\n(Image: Swansea Council)\\n\\nSam Smith Travel is a trading name of Ocky White Travel, an award winning and respected independent agency in west Wales, established around 60 years ago. As well as its Mumbles base, Sam Smith Travel has two other high street outlets - in Cowbridge and Pontyclun.\\n\\nThe Mumbles coastal protection project aims to reduce the risk of flooding to homes and businesses that are increasingly threatened by rising sea levels brought about by climate change. Swansea Council leader Rob Stewart said: \\u201cIt\\u2019s great to see new businesses showing confidence in Mumbles as we work towards finishing our sea defences scheme in the near future. The seawall project will protect the community for generations to come and will greatly improve the experience of visiting the prom.\\n\\n\\u201cI thank those who have lived and worked close to the prom during the work; their understanding is much appreciated by our staff and contractors. As our works progress, Mumbles, its businesses, organisations and events remain open and accessible by road, on foot and by bike.\\u201d\",\n          \"Ministers making 'painfully slow' cladding progress\\n\\n12 hours ago Share Save Share Save\\n\\nPA Media Eight years have passed since 72 people died in the Grenfell Tower disaster\\n\\nThe Scottish government has been accused of making \\\"painfully slow\\\" progress on removing unsafe cladding from buildings. It came as ministers announced plans to speed up efforts to inspect and repair buildings in response to the 2017 Grenfell Tower disaster. Housing Minister Paul McLennan announced that people with concerns about unsafe cladding would be able to apply to a \\u00a310m fund to have their building assessed. But opposition MSPs criticised the government for failing to confirm a date when the work would be completed.\\n\\nMcLennan also defended the government's housebuilding record after it was announced the number of new homes built in Scotland last year slumped to less than 20,000, with completions by the social sector down by almost a quarter.\\n\\nA cladding remediation programme was set up in the aftermath of the Grenfell tower block disaster in London, which claimed 72 lives. However, ministers have been criticised for its slow progress. As of November 2024 there were 107 entries on the programme \\u2013 which can be either individual buildings or multiple properties in a development. The government said in September that work had not been completed on any of the buildings, with work having started on just five. UK government statistics for England showed that, as of September last year, remediation work on unsafe cladding had been started or completed on half of about 5,000 identified buildings, with work completed on almost a third (29%) of them.\\n\\n'Plan of action'\\n\\nIn a statement to parliament, McLennan announced a \\\"renewed plan of action\\\" on cladding remediation alongside as the government published its response to the second phase of the Grenfell Inquiry. He said the \\u00a310m fund would be open to properties owned by local authorities, registered social landlords and privately individuals. \\\"This investment is designed to reduce risk and the broadest range of properties as quick as possible,\\\" the minister said. MSPs unanimously passed the Housing Cladding Remediation Bill in May last year in a bid to speed up the process. It gave ministers the power to assess and carry out remediation on buildings with unsafe cladding - with any work then recorded in a special register. But as of last year it was reported that only \\u00a39m out of \\u00a397m received from Westminster via Barnett consequentials to deal with the issue had been spent. McLennan did not provide an update on the work done on the 107 earmarked properties, or how much of the UK government money had been spent.\\n\\nScottish Conservative housing spokesperson Meghan Gallacher said progress had been \\\"painfully slow\\\" in the eight years since the Grenfell disaster. She said Scotland was \\\"miles behind\\\" the UK government in removing unsafe cladding south of the border, describing the announcement as a \\\"kick in the teeth\\\" to concerned residents. Speaking after the statement, the MSP said: \\\"Despite receiving nearly \\u00a3100m from the UK government to fix the problem, work has only begun on five of 107 affected properties and Paul McLennan clearly has no clue when that work will be completed.\\\" Labour housing spokesperson Mark Griffin said: \\\"We're in a remarkable position where we've had more ministerial statements on cladding than we've had buildings remediated.\\\"\\n\\nPA Media Fewer than 20,000 homes were built in Scotland last year\",\n          \"Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

The probe aims to uncover the depth of the illegal transactions and any further connections to the broader smuggling network.\\n\\nGold bars worth Rs 12.56 crore were seized from Ranya, the step-daughter of DGP-rank officer K Ramachandra Rao at Kempegowda International Airport on March 3 upon her arrival from Dubai.\\n\\nFollowing this, searches were conducted at her residence, where officials recovered gold jewellery worth Rs 2.06 crore and Indian currency amounting to Rs 2.67 crore, the DRI had stated.\\n\\nLater, the DGP-rank officer was sent on compulsory leave by the Karnataka government and was questioned in connection with the gold smuggling case.\\n\\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)\",\n          \"How long would you wait for a Michelin-star treat?

Cronin is expecting just as many people hoping to get their hands on one of these flaky goods this time around, too.\\n\\n\\u201cIt was incredible to see how excited people were,\\u201d she shared.\\n\\nPrevious pop-ups for the coveted pastries drew both New Yorkers and customers from all over the world, including India and Spain, Cronin said.\\n\\n12 Madison Squares are the latest pastry to take NYC by storm.\\n\\n12 Madison Squares are drawing lines even longer than the great cronut craze. LP Media\\n\\nOn one such Saturday in November, Amy Saunders and Anne Marie Janeway queued hours before the pop-up opened at 7:30 a.m. and 8 a.m., respectively.\\n\\nSaunders, 29, had tried to come another time but was too late. Having arrived at 9:30 a.m., she joined the line that wrapped to Park Avenue, only to be told they ran out by the time she got to the corner of 25th Street and Madison Avenue.\\n\\n12 Cronin (left) and her team took the flakiness, soft interior and layers of a croissant and turned it into something new.\\n\\nJaneway said she\\u2019s waited multiple times for Madison Squares.\\n\\n\\u201cThis is my third time waiting.

Every week, Cronin introduces a new flavor for the Bake It Nice pop-up, and while the exact flavors for this rendition remain a surprise, foodies can expect bright, bold combinations that capture the essence of spring.\\n\\nPrevious fan-favorites have included strawberry rhubarb, orange blossom and chocolate pretzel praline. Last fall, the pastry chef combined nutty flavors like hazelnut, golden sesame and chestnuts with autumnal produce like apples and pumpkins.\\n\\nVariety draws people back, too. \\u201cThey change the flavors every week, I don\\u2019t want to miss out,\\u201d Janeway said of why she keeps coming back.\\n\\nThough the pastries come from a fine-dining Michelin-star restaurant, Bake It Nice has allowed Eleven Madison Park to \\u201cconnect with people in a more casual environment\\u201d \\u2014 especially people who haven\\u2019t been able to dine at the main restaurant, Cronin said.\\n\\n12 \\u201cWe travel here together, and we are all dining tomorrow at the restaurant and saw that they were having the pop-up today, so we wanted to come and enjoy their pastries,\\u201d said San Diegans Vijay (from left), 31, Punam, 32, Nikhil, 32, and Pooja, 30.

English Channel (LPhot Edward Jones/MoD/Crown Copyright)\\n\\nThe Royal Navy has shadowed three Russian ships through the English Channel.\\n\\nBritish minehunter HMS Cattistock and a Wildcat helicopter were deployed on Wednesday to escort Russia\\u2019s Admiral Vladimirskiy \\u2013 an oceanographic survey ship previously accused of involvement in an operation to map the UK\\u2019s critical undersea infrastructure \\u2013 as it travelled along the UK\\u2019s south coast.\\n\\nThe British minehunter worked closely with the helicopter to \\u201ckeep a constant watch\\u201d as the Russian vessel passed through the busy shipping lane, the Royal Navy said.\\n\\nThis operation was followed rapidly by another, as HMS Somerset and tanker RFA Tidesurge were deployed to escort Russian landing ship RFN Alexander Otrakovsky and merchant vessel MV Ascalon through the Channel and North Sea.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nThe pair of Russian ships were sailing towards the Baltic Sea and had recently left the Mediterranean.\\n\\nA 2023 report claimed the Admiral Vladimirsky sailed for a month with its transmitter turned off and loitered near UK wind farms (LPhot Edward Jones/MoD/Crown Copyright/PA Wire)\\n\\nThese latest operations follow a similar mission last week which saw Royal Navy warships and helicopters track a Russian task group returning from Syria \\u2013 where Russia has reportedly been withdrawing from its prized foothold at the Tartus naval base, after the regime of Vladimir Putin\\u2019s ally Bashar al-Assad dramatically collapsed in December.\\n\\nHMS Somerset has been deployed to monitor Russian convoys returning from the Mediterranean three times in the past month alone and recently visited Aberdeen to refuel for their latest mission.\\n\\nThis latest interaction between the Royal Navy and a Russian survey ship comes just weeks after Britain\\u2019s defence secretary John Healey disclosed to MPs that another Russian survey ship \\u2013 the Yantar \\u2013 had been closely monitored by the Royal Navy after entering UK waters in both January and November.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\n\\u201cLet me be clear, this is a Russian spy ship used for gathering intelligence and mapping the UK\\u2019s critical underwater infrastructure,\\u201d the defence secretary told the House of Commons in January.\\n\\nRevealing that he had changed the Royal Navy\\u2019s rules of engagement to allow British warships to more closely track Yantar, Mr Healey said: \\u201cI also wanted President Putin to hear this message: we see you, we know what you\\u2019re doing and we will not shy away from robust action to protect this country.\\u201d\\n\\nAdmiral Vladimirskiy \\u2013 the ship shadowed in the Channel last week \\u2013 has also faced allegations of operating as a spy ship.\\n\\nPrime minister Keir Starmer and defence secretary John Healey recently visited a Vanguard class submarine off the coast of Scotland as it returned home from a period of duty at sea (Simon Dawson / No 10 Downing Street)\\n\\nIn April 2023, a joint report by broadcasters in Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Norway claimed the Admiral Vladimirsky was part of a covert operation to map undersea infrastructure.\\n\\nAs part of that investigation, the ship was tracked in the vicinity of seven wind farms off the coast of the UK and the Netherlands during one alleged mission, in which it reportedly sailed for a month with its transmitter switched off.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nWhen a reporter with Danish broadcaster DR approached the ship on a small boat near Denmark\\u2019s coast in November 2022, he was confronted by a masked individual carrying what appeared to be a military assault rifle.\\n\\nThe latest development in the Channel came as Russian officials met for US-led talks in Saudi Arabia, as the Trump administration pushes for a ceasefire in the Ukraine war.\\n\\nAhead of their first meeting in Riyadh on Sunday, Russia said its main objective in talks would be to secure a ceasefire in the Black Sea \\u2013 which the White House said on Tuesday had been agreed by both Moscow and Kyiv.\\n\\nWhile Ukraine said the ceasefire was

      "ARTICLE: Kannada actress Harshavardhini Ranya alias Ranya Rao who was arrested in a gold smuggling case, has admitted to using hawala channels for purchases, the prosecution argued before a special court on Tuesday. Gold bars worth Rs 12.56 crore were seized from Ranya, the step-daughter of DGP-rank officer K Ramachandra Rao at Kempegowda International Airport on March 3 upon her arrival from Dubai. Following this, searches were conducted at her residence, where officials recovered gold jewellery worth Rs 2.06 crore and Indian currency amounting to Rs 2.67 crore, the DRI had stated.

They might be better served singing The Grand Old Duke of York. Only those 10,000 men on that hill could possibly relate to the absurdities of Bournemouth\\u2019s afternoon engagement with Sheffield Wednesday. In sequence, they went from top to third to second to top to second again in the space of one 2-2 draw. They are neither up nor down; they are neither falling apart nor running away with the loot. How delightfully fitting in this remarkable season of Championship football that a team unbeaten in 10 before Saturday\\u2019s kick-off would draw at home to a side with nothing to gain or lose. Chris Maguire converts an injury time penalty so salvage a draw for Sheffield Wednesday at Dean Court . Maguire celebrates his late, late strike as the Owls held Bournemouth to a draw on their home turf . The battle for automatic promotion to the Premier League is hotting up with three points covering four teams and with two games to play. 1 Watford 85pts To play Apr 25 Brighton (a), May 2 Sheff Wed (h) 2 Bournemouth 84pts Apr 27 Bolton (h), May 2 Charlton (a) 3 Middlesbrough 84pts Apr 25 Fulham (a), May 2 Brighton (h) 4 Norwich 82pts Apr 25 Rotherham (a), May 2 Fulham (h) And how. They dominated, then they trailed, then they levelled and had a man sent off. Then their fans got mocked by a Wednesday player and then they led and then the player that did the mocking scored a penalty in stoppage time that irritated the home crowd all over again. Brilliantly bonkers. How significantly will Chris Maguire of Wednesday feature in Bournemouth\\u2019s final analysis? How serious was Eddie Howe when he indicated that the referees feel Bournemouth, at 15 kicks, have reached their quota for penalties this season? He was unhappy, to put it mildly, that Lewis Buxton was cleared of fouling Callum Wilson in the second half, telling a radio station: \\u2018It looked like the referees have come together and talked about Callum Wilson and said, \\u201cDon\\u2019t give him any penalties because Bournemouth have had too many this season and we don\\u2019t want them to have any more\\u201d.\\u2019 Kieran Lee (second right) celebrates with his team after his\\u00a036th minute header put the visitors ahead . He toned down his sentiments by the time he met the written press and that is probably for the best. Howe is a good and rational man; certainly one of the most upwardly mobile and promising of all English coaches. A sign of the pressure of this incredible promotion race, then? Who could blame him if it was? Middlesbrough had beaten Norwich on Friday night to take Bournemouth\\u2019s place at the top and at 3.36pm on Saturday Kieran Lee put Wednesday in front. When Craig Cathcart scored a magnificent volley for Watford against Birmingham \\u2014 the only goal of the match \\u2014 Watford were top and Bournemouth were third. The natives grew restless. Then Yann Kermorgant equalised, lifting Bournemouth back up to second, and a home fan screamed into a camcorder held by a policeman. Senses take leave at this time of a season, which might also explain how Simon Francis quickly landed himself a second yellow card. Maguire turned to the home fans and motioned for them to dry their eyes. Alas, Matt Ritchie then hit the top corner and put Bournemouth top again but in stoppage time Adam Smith fouled Atdhe Nuhiu for a penalty. \\u2018No-one will blame Adam,\\u2019 Howe said. \\u2018We will tell him how much we love him tonight.\\u2019 Yann Kermorgant (second left equalises for the Cherries with 20 minutes of the contest remaining . Bournemouth's Simon Francis is dismissed by referee Paul Tierney in the 78th minute . Which is nice, though Maguire did score the penalty and Bournemouth did fall. Again. Howe said he felt \\u2018heartbroken\\u2019. Over the course of two spells at Bournemouth he has led them from League Two to this precipice, occasionally spending his own money in the darker days when the club was broke. Today, in their tiny stadium where parking costs \\u00a31 and stewards are encouraged to say hello, they are so close to something incredible. Tommy Elphick, Bournemouth\\u2019s captain, gave something of an insight into what his manager has been going through. \\u2018He is probably the first one every day in at 6 or 7 and probably leaving at 6 or 7 at night and the players follow suit,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018We realise how much he does for us. When a single person gives that much of their life towards you, you only want to repay them.\\u2019 But the best intentions can only do so much in a race like this. Promotion is worth somewhere in the region of \\u00a3120million and, as of the weekend, eight teams are in the hunt for three spots. Multiple narratives, multiple charges and multiple futures on the line. It\\u2019s crazy but it\\u2019s brilliant. With only two games to play it has been a magnificent race up the hill. Matt Ritchie races away to celebrate after his 85th minute free kick put the home side ahead for the first time .\",\n          \"A professor testifying in a cold-case trial in Southern California said Thursday that she was intimidated into identifying her rapist to the man now charged with killing him in 1995. Norma Esparza, who pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in the case and agreed to testify, said from the stand that her ex-boyfriend, Gianni Van, now 45, was outraged when he heard about the assault and demanded that she find and point out Gonzalo Ramirez at the bar where she met him. Van is now charged with the murder of Ramirez. Prosecutors allege Van and friends kidnapped and beat Ramirez and left him by the roadside. 'I was intimidated': Norma Esparza, pictured here during a press conference in 2013, testified Thursday at the murder trial of ex-boyfriend, Gianni Van, 45, who is charged with killing a man in 1995 she claims raped her. She says Van intimidated her into identifying the murder victim,\\u00a0Gonzalo Ramirez . Accused: Gianni Van, 45, (left) is accused of the 1995 murder of Gonzalo Ramirez (right), whose blindfolded, bloodied body was found on the side of an Irvine, California road having suffered 30 blows with a cleaver . 'We were sitting around a booth next to an entrance or exit, and at some point I see Gonzalo Ramirez walk by,' Esparza said of the night in 1995, according to the Orange County Register. 'When I see him, I cringe,' she said, showing how she reacted by bending her head down and putting her face in her hands. 'I didn't want to see him again.' Esparza, testifying in the trial's second day, said she was 'broken' by the assault, that Van was directing his anger not just at her attacker but at her, and that she did not know what Van and his friends would do once she pointed out Ramirez. 'He would just insult me,' she said. 'He would rant and just be explosive.' Revenge? Prosecutors say Van killed Ramirez as revenge for raping his on-and-off girlfriend Norma Esparza (pictured). They divorced and Esparza went on to become a psychology professor in Europe and the mother of a little girl (left). Esparza is pictured right upon her arrest while re-entering the U.S. in 2012 . Van's lawyer, Jeremy Dolnick, said his client had no role in the murder and knew nothing of any plans to kidnap or kill Ramirez. The case has drawn international attention since Esparza \\u2014 who went on to become a psychology professor and moved to France \\u2014 was arrested in 2012, provoking an outcry from advocates for sexual assault victims who say the case sends a chilling message to rape survivors. Esparza, 40, is expected to receive a six-year sentence in exchange for testifying at the trials of Van and another defendant. During opening statements this week, Senior Deputy District Attorney Mike Murray showed graphic photos of Ramirez's blindfolded, mangled body lying on the side of the road in a pool of blood. 'Gonzalo Ramirez was targeted, and he was targeted by somebody who was going to make sure he suffered,' Murray said. 'Whether Norma Esparza was sexually assaulted or not, for our purposes today, doesn't matter. What matters is she told the defendant that. Involved? The prosecution alleges Van was aided by his friend Kody Tran (center) \\u00a0and Tran's wife Diane Tran (right) as well as Tran's employee Shannon Gries (left). Kody Tran killed himself during an unrelated standoff with police in 2013. Diane Tran has taken a plea deal and will testify against Van. Shannon Gries awaits trial on murder charges . Prosecutors say Ramirez was taken to the transmission shop of his friend Kody Tran, where he was blindfolded, chained up and beaten. They say he was found having suffered 30 blows from a meat cleaver, reports the Orange County Register. The prosecution alleges Van was aided by Tran and Tran's wife Diane Tran as well as Tran's employee Shannon Gries. His body was found dumped on the side of a road in Irvine. 'It was beyond horrific,' Murray said. 'It was the act of an incredibly angry man...The defendant was out of his mind with anger.' 'He felt that he had been violated,' Murray said of Van.\",\n          \"A 51-year-old mother   fought off an intruder after finding him standing over her young daughter.
